<h4>Introduction</h4>
PL/I is a powerful programming language suitable for a wide range of
problems.  PL/I has been used to write operating systems and compilers,
simulations, real-time programs, mathematical software, spreadsheets,
GUI programs, and for general computing.
<p>
PL/I is widely used on mainframes and midrange systems today, but since 
the demise of Digital Research, Inc. has not been easily available on 
personal computers.
Iron Spring Software was founded in 2007 with the intention of bringing the
flexibility, reliability, and portability, and security of PL/I to a
wider market.
<p>
Iron Spring PL/I is the leading cross-platform PL/I compiler supporting
both Linux and OS/2.  Both native and cross-compilation are supported.
<p>
This version of Iron Spring PL/I is still missing some features 
of full PL/I.
The section <a href="#rest">Restrictions</a> lists many of the 
missing features.
<p> 
<!----- Modifications ----->
<a name="chg">

Summary of Changes for 1.4.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Array expressions are now supported for non-adjustable arrays.<br>
    A+S, S+A, and A+A are allowed where A is an array, S is a scalar,
    and + can be any operator. Currently builtins are not allowed, so
    A=ABS(A), for example, will return the scalar ABS(A(1)). The array
    bounds must be constant and the elements cannot be adjustable strings.
<li>The %REPLACE preprocessor statement has been enhanced to replace a
    sequence of tokens rather than a single token.
    <pre style="display:inline"><tt>
    %replace word by "fixed binary(31)";
    declare a word; 
    </tt></pre>
 effectively generates the following declaration: declare A fixed bin(31,0);
<li>The compiler option -ln will show a statement's nesting level
    within a block and do-group.
<li>The ISO-8859-15 "Not Sign" 'AC'x (¬) is now a builtin default 
     in addition to the Codepage 850 value 'AA'x.
     This reduces the number of additional alternates that can be 
     specified to three.
<li>The builtin ENTRYADDR can now be used as an initializer for
    STATIC or EXTERNAL pointer variables.
<li>The <i>Guide</i> section <a href="#int">Internal representation</a> has been
    updated to include some program control data types previously omitted.
</ul>
<p>

Summary of Changes for 1.3.2<br>
<ul>
<li>This version now supports hexadecimal binary fixed-point literals
    (from IBM Enterprise PL/I). The syntax is:
    <ul>
      <li>"&lt;0 to 8 hex digits&gt;"XN (for signed values)
      <li>"&lt;0 to 8 hex digits&gt;"XU (for unsigned values)
    </ul>
    These constants are big-endian REAL FIXED BINARY, either signed 
    with precision(31,0) or unsigned (32,0). Note that these are 
    written as strings enclosed in single or double quotes, followed 
    immediately by "xu" or "xn" (case not significant), with no 
    intervening spaces. Underscores may be used to separate groups 
    of digits as desired. Values shorter than eight digits are padded 
    on the left with zeroes.<br>
    Examples:
    <tt>
    <ul>
      <li>put skip list('80'XU);         ->  128
      <li>put skip list("FFFF_FFFF"XN);  -> -1
      <li>put skip list('FFFFFFFF'xu);  ->  4294967295
    </ul>
    </tt>
</ul>
<p>

Summary of Changes for 1.3.1<br>
<ul>
<li>The ITERATE statement is now supported
<blockquote>
"The ITERATE statement transfers control to the END statement that delimits 
its containing iterative
do-group. The current iteration completes and the next iteration, if needed, 
is started.
The ITERATE statement can be specified inside a non-iterative do-group 
as long as that do-group is
contained by an iterative do-group.
<p>
If ITERATE &lt;label-constant&gt; is specified, label-constant must be the label 
of a containing iterative do-group. 
If label-constant is omitted, control transfers to the END
statement of the most recent iterative do-group containing the ITERATE statement."
</blockquote>
<li>The operation and description of the STRING builtin function and pseudovariable
    have been changed slightly. See the description in <a href="#bif">Builtin Functions and Pseudovariables</a>
    STRING is not completely compatible among different compilers, and
    this version is not completely compatible with any.
</ul>
<p>

Summary of Changes for 1.3.0<br>
<ul>
<li>iSub defined arrays are now supported. This is an alpha feature 
    in this release.
<li>Undeclared user-defined conditions will now produce warning
    message 557. To avoid this declare the name as a CONDITION. This
    is not required with standard PL/I conditions.
<li>Improvements to handing arrays of structures.
<li>(Linux) Compiler changed to use "large filesystem" calls fstat64 
</ul>

<!----- Restrictions ----->
<a name="rest">
<p>
<h4>Restrictions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Unicode<dd>Unicode is not supported.
<dt>INITIAL<dd>INITIAL attribute generates incorrect results for arrays 
        of structures of unaligned bit elements.
<dt>STREAM INPUT
    <dd>GET DATA is not yet implemented.<br>
    C and E format codes and FLOAT pictures not implemented for GET EDIT.<br>
    Due to a difference in data formats Edit-directed 
    stream input may not be compatible with mainframe PL/I. See note on 
    <a href="#stream">stream input compatibility.</a><br>
    The COPY option of the GET statement, the NAME condition, and the 
    DATAFIELD builtin functions are not supported.
    <dd>
 <dt>RECORD I/O<dd>The statements REWRITE, LOCATE, DELETE, and UNLOCK, and are
    not supported for non-ISAM files.<br>
    For ISAM files (Linux only) the statements LOCATE and UNLOCK, and the
    builtin functions ONKEY, and SAMEKEY are not supported. 
<dt>For better integration with 'ld' on Linux, the external
    procedure name 'main' is reserved and should not be used.
<dt>Interlanguage 
<dd>PL/I procedures can call functions coded in other languages as 
    long as they use the "SYSTEM" or "CDECL" calling convention.  The "OPTLINK"
    and other calling conventions are not supported.
    Programs in other languages can call PL/I procedures with restrictions.
    The main program <b>must be</b> PL/I.
    See <a href="#lnk">Program Linkage</a> for more information. 
<dt>Preprocessor
<dd>The only preprocessor statements
    fully implemented by the <b>built-in</b> preprocessor are %INCLUDE and 
    the listing
    control statements %PAGE, %SKIP[(n)], %PRINT,
    %NOPRINT, and %REPLACE.  %PROCESS (*PROCESS) is implemented incompatibly 
    from the IBM compilers. 
    All other preprocessor statements will generate a diagnostic.<br>
    See <a href="#pre">Preprocessor</a> for more information.<br>
    The beta version of the <b>full preprocessor</b> is described in 
    <a href="Iron-SpringPLIPreprocessor.pdf">Iron-SpringPLIPreprocessor.pdf</a>. 
<dt>COMPLEX attribute is not yet fully supported.
<dt>GENERIC attribute is not implemented. If anyone wants to use 
    GENERIC, please let us know.
<dt>DEFAULT statement is recognized but ignored.
<dt>DISPLAY<dd>The EVENT option of the DISPLAY statement is not 
    currently supported. 
<dt>The FETCH and RELEASE statements are not currently implemented.
</table>
<dt>Arithmetic builtins
<dd>The TRUNC arithmetic builtin function is not implemented for FLOAT
    data in the current version of the compiler.
<dt>COMPLEX pseudovariable
<dd>The COMPLEX pseudovariable (not builtin function) is not supported. This corresponds with
    the IBM Enterprise PL/I compilers. The REAL and IMAG builtins can be 
    used instead. This is a permanent restriction.
<dt>Builtins PLICKPT, PLICANC, PLIREST, PLITEST
<dd>These builtins are not implemented. This is a permanent restriction.
<dt>PLISRTx
<dd>The sort builtin function PLISRTD is supported. PLISRTA, PLISRTB, and PLISRTC
    are not currently implemented.  It is anticipated that versions of these functions, 
    and possible interfaces to one or more sort products will be added in the future.
<dt>Aggregate Results
<dd>Builtin functions will not return agregate results in the current
    version.  This is similar to <i>Subset G</i> support for builtins.
    PL/I procedures may return non-adjustable arrays, but procedures
    returning structures are not yet supported.
<dt>GRAPHIC data
<dd>GRAPHIC data support will not be included in this compiler.  This is a 
    permanent restriction.
    A future version will include WIDECHAR data for UTF-16 support.  
    The features not supported include the GRAPHIC attribute and
    the GRAPHIC and MPSTR builtin functions.
<dt>LIKE
<dd>The LIKE attribute is implemented with one restriction.  If a structure is declared
    as <tt>DECLARE a LIKE b;</tt> and some elements of "b" have the INITIAL
    attribute, the initialization is not performed for "a".  This will be fixed in a future version.
<dt>UNION
<dd>The UNION (CELL) attribute may not be used in adjustable structures. <!-- NOTE:
    is this still true? -->
<dt>Array cross sections
<dd>Array cross sections are not currently supported, but will be in an
    upcoming release.
<dt>Array expressions
<dd>Array expressions are not allowed with adjustable arrays.           
</dl>
<p>

<b>Other restrictions</b><br>
This list may not be exhaustive at the present time.
The compiler error message 995 ("Unimplemented feature xxx") and the
run-time condition "UNIMPLEMENTED" are used to flag unimplemented 
features.  Except for "permanent restrictions" noted above,
these will be removed in future releases.  Some infrequently-used
conversions may still be only partially implemented.

<h4>Documentation</h4>
Complete documentation for Iron Spring PL/I will 
be available as part of a future release.  In the meantime, documentation
for the IBM "PL/I for MVS and VM Compiler 1.1" is available 
<a href="http://teampli.net/SC26-3114-01.pdf">online</a>.
<hr width="25%">

<!----- Differences ----->
<a name="diff">
<p>
<h4>Compiler Differences</h4>
The reference implementation for this compiler is IBM PL/I for MVS and VM 1.1. 
some features from other compilers have been incorporated.
Most of the differences  from INM PL/I 1.1 are in the area of Input/Output. 
See the section <a href="#io">Input and Output</a> for a description of
the input/output facilities.
<p>
See <a href="#rest">Restrictions</a> for information on major language
features that are not currently implemented.

<dl>
<dt>Character representation
<dd>Multiple alternate characters can be used to represent
OR and NOT.  Either the single or double quote can be used as a string delimiter.
<dt>DECIMAL FLOAT
<dd>At the present time, DECIMAL FLOAT data is simulated using BINARY FLOAT. 
    This is similar to S/370 PL/I implementations that simulate both 
   DECIMAL FLOAT and BINARY FLOAT using the hardware Hexadecimal floating point formats.
<dt>FIXED BINARY
<dd>FIXED BINARY data with precision 7 or less is stored in a single byte.
<dt>E Format
<dd>E Format output will print four digits for exponent instead of two.
Output field widths may need to be adjusted.
<dt>STRING
<dd>The STRING builtin function and pseudovariable restrict the range of data
allowed as arguments.  This should not affect most normal use of STRING.  See
the section <a href="#bif">Builtin Functions and Pseudovariables</a> for the definition
of STRING.
<dt>DATE, TIME, DATETIME
<dd>Most Linux systems maintain the date and time in UTC. These builtins return
the value supplied by the system. It is possible to instruct the OS to
maintain the date and time in localtime, if desired.
<dt>ONCODE
<dd>The ONCODE builtin function returns only the base value of the error code.
For example, IBM PL/I can return codes 600 to 639 for CONVERSION.  This compiler will
return 600 in all cases. See <a href="#oncode">list of oncodes</a>.
<dt>Additional builtins
<dd>See the section <a href="#bif">Builtin Functions and Pseudovariables</a>
 for the definitions of all supported builtin functions.
<dt>ATTENTION
<dd>The ATTENTION condition is enabled by default.  It is raised by pressing CONTROL/C while running
a text-mode application or otherwise sending XCPT_SIGNAL_INTR/SIGINT to the PL/I process.  
If no ON-Unit is established for ATTENTION, the implicit action is the same as for ERROR: 
print an error message and raise the FINISH condition.  
On normal return from an established ON-Unit, execution continues unaffected.
Note that ATTENTION will be raised <u><b>only</b></u> in the initial task/thread
<dt>RETURNS keyword
<dd>Procedure and Entry statements (<i>not</i> ENTRY <i>declarations</i>) 
may specify "RETURNS(&nbsp;CHARACTER(*) [VARYING] )", or
"RETURNS(&nbsp;BIT(*) [VARYING] )".  The length of the returned string is determined by the entry declaration
in the calling program, e.g.:<br>
<tt>DECLARE a ENTRY RETURNS( CHARACTER(20) );</tt>.<br>  
IBM compilers require an explicit length and will not allow '*'.
<dt>EXTERNAL Attribute and Program Linkage
<dd>The EXTERNAL attribute has been enhanced to allow the provision of a non-PL/I name visible to procedures
outside the PL/I program.  The syntax is:<br>
<tt>DECLARE x EXTERNAL( 'environment_name' )</tt><br>
See <a href="#lnk">Program Linkage.</a> for more details.

<!----- Running ----->
<a name="run">
<p>
<h4>Running the Compiler</h4>
The "plic" command is used to invoke the compiler.<br>
<p>
The syntax of the plic command is shown.  The case of the option switches is significant.  Lower-case options
have parameters, upper-case do not.
<pre><tt>
   plic [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;input files&gt; [-o &lt;output file&gt;]

        &lt;options&gt; = &lt;output option&gt;    [&lt;include options&gt;]         [&lt;listing options&gt;]
                    [&lt;source margins&gt;] [&lt;character substitutions&gt;] [&lt;version info&gt;]
                    [&lt;error option&gt;]   [&lt;misc options&gt;]
                    [&lt;optimization option&gt;]

        Options may be entered in any order.
        The Linux shell requires that options containing () be enclosed in double quotes (").  

        &lt;<b>output option</b>&gt; = -S | -C | -L
                          -S = generate assembler (symbolic) output.
                          -C = generate compiled (object) output.
                          -L = generated linked (EXE or DLL) output.
                               (this option not currently implemented.}
                          -N = generate statement number table to provide
                               information for run-time error messages

        &lt;<b>include options</b>&gt; = -i&lt;directory&gt;
                            where &lt;directory&gt; is the absolute or relative path 
                            to a directory to be searched for %INCLUDE files.
                            This option may be used more than once on the command line,
                            and directories will be searched in the order listed.

        &lt;<b>listing options</b>&gt; =  -l[siaxgmovn]
                            one or more of [siaxgmovn] may be entered, in any order as -lsx
                            -ls = list source
                            -li = list insource
                            -la = list attributes
                            -lx = list cross-reference
                            -lg = list aggregates
                            -lm = list generated code in a format similar to an
                                       assembly listing 
			    -lo = list procedure map (statement offset table)
			    -lv = list additional warning messages           
			    -ln = include statement nesting level in source listing.

        &lt;<b>source margins</b>&gt; = -m(start[,end])
                           This option defines the first and last positions of each
                           input line that contain input for the compiler.  If this
                           option is omitted the source is assumed to be the entire line.
                           This option is included for compatibility with mainframe compilers
                           which would use, for example, -m(2,72).

        &lt;<b>character substitutions</b>&gt; = -cn(&lt;list&gt;) and/or
                                    -co(&lt;list&gt;)
                            This option defines up to four characters each to be used as
                            substitutions for the NOT(&not;) [-cn()] and/or OR(|) [-co()]
                            operator IN ADDITION TO the defaults.  The caret (^) is
                            a metacharacter for the OS/2 command processor; if the
                            caret is to be used, code two consecutive carets,
                            for example -cn(^^).

        &lt;<b>version info</b>&gt; = -V
                         The compiler prints version and copyright information on stderr.

        &lt;<b>error option</b>&gt; = -e&lt;option&gt;
                         This option sets the errorlevel returned by the compiler for warning
                         and error messages.  Normally compiler returns 4 if only warnings were
                         issued, and 8 for any errors.
                         -ew tells the compiler to return 0 if only warning messages were issued.
                         -es tells the compiler to return 0 if any errors <u>or</u> warnings were issued.
                           This option is useful when the compiler is run from a script or makefile.
                         -ed tells the compiler to display messages on stderr as well as stdout.         

        &lt;<b>misc options</b>&gt; = -d&lt;option&gt;
                         &lt;option&gt; is a character string, with or without enclosing quotes.
                         -dLIB tells the compiler it is compiling a standard run-time library procedure.
                         -dELF causes the compiler to generate ELF object files.
                         -dOMF causes the compiler to generate OMF object files.
                         The default is to generate the standard object format for the host OS;
                         for OS/2 -dOMF is the default.

        &lt;<b>optimization option</b>&gt; = -O enables optimizations

        &lt;<b>input files</b>&gt; and &lt;<b>output files</b>&gt; are absolute or relative path names.  Only one input and one
                         one output file are currently allowed.  If the output file is omitted the name
                         is generated.  For example, PLIC -S abc.pli will create a file named abc.asm.

<h4>Linking PL/I Programs</h4>
The "Readme" file for your environment - <a href="readme_linux.html">Linux</a> or 
<a href="readme_os2.html">OS/2</a> contains information on linking PL/I programs.

<p>
<hr width="25%">

<!------ Input    -->
<a name="inp">
<p>
<h4>Compiler input</h4>
Compiler input is a standard text file [ENV(TEXT)]. Conventionally, the source
program might have the extension ".pli" or ".pl1", but this is not required. Lines are delimited by Newline 
characters ('0A'x).  There is no limitation on line length, although individual <i>tokens</i> such as 
character-strings are limited to approximately 32,000 characters. Other than newlines, characters 
lower in the collating-sequence than spaces ('20'x) are ignored.  This means, therefore, that at the
present time they should not be coded in character string constants.  To compile a character string
constant containing one or more of these characters concatenate the hexadecimal value, for example:
<pre><tt>
declare two_line_constant char(24) static initial( ('Line one' || '0D0A'x || 'Line two.') );
</tt></pre>
This type of expression is resolved at compile-time and does not generate any additional code.
<p>
The compiler character set is Codepage 850.
The default representations for the <b>OR</b> character is '|', '7C'x, 
and for <b>NOT</b> '&not;', 'AA'x.  The corresponding unicode characters are 
U+007C [bar, vertical], and U+00AC [NOT SIGN].
The character or characters specified above under
<a href="#run">Running the compiler</a>, the options -cn and -co can be used to indicate <b>additional</b>
encodings used to represent these characters.
<p>
String data can be delimited by either the single (')
or double (") quote characters.  The same character must be used to begin and end the
string.  The character <u>not</u> used as a delimiter may be part of the string.
If portability is a concern, use only the single-quote to delimit strings.  The character used as a 
delimiter can be included in the string by specifying it twice in succession, for example,
'Let''s dance' will be compiled as <b>Let's dance</b>, """Fine"", he said" as <b>"Fine", he said</b>.
<p>
Source lines are logically continued from the right margin of one line to the left margin of the next,
with no whitespace assumed between the two character positions.
(see the -m compiler option).  Any characters outside the margins, as well as any characters lower
than space in the collating sequence, are ignored.  For example:
<pre><tt>
         Left Margin            Right Margin                  Line End
             |                       |                            |
             "This is a continued charsome stuff outside the margin
 extra stuff acter string"
</tt></pre>
will be compiled as <b>This is a continued character string</b>.
<p>
<i>If a line ends with a word or a number with no trailing blank, and another
word or number begins in the left margin of the next line the two  will be considered a single
token.  A future release will cause words and numbers, but not strings, operators, etc.,
to break at the end of a line.</i> 
<p>
<b>INCLUDE</b> files are identical in format to the source file.  Currently INCLUDE files <b>must</b>
have either no extension or the extension ".inc" or ".cpy".  The compiler option -i, which can be 
repeated multiple times, 
provides a list of directories to be searched, in the order written, to locate an INCLUDE file.
The current working directory is always searched last if the file is not found sooner.  INCLUDE files
use the same list of alternate characters as the source, and must use the same margins,
although a future release will allow these to be overridden for each individual file.

<h4>Compiler output</h4>
If any of the listing options (-l<i>x</i>) is specified, compiling a program xxx.pli 
will create a source listing file named xxx.lst.
<p>
Compiler output currently consists of the optional 
 <a href='#src'>source</a>,
 <a href="#asml">assembler</a>,
 <a href='#off'>statement offset table</a>,
 <a href='#aggr'>aggregate map</a>,
and <a href="#att">symbol attribute, and cross-reference</a> listings,
and an optional <a href='#obj'>object file</a> or <a href='#asm'>assembler file</a> of the compiled program.
<p>
All pages of the listing have a heading similar to the following showing the date and time of compilation
and the compiler version used.  The title is taken from the first line of the source file.
The subheading identifies the "Source Listing", the "Assembly Listing", the "Procedure Map", 
the "Aggregate Listing", 
and the "Symbol Table and Cross-Reference Listing."

</tt></pre>
<p>
<font color="blue">'B'</font> is the line number.  The source file and each %include file
are numbered starting from line one.  A future compiler version will also provide a file 
number for each include file to be used on error messages.
<p>
<font color="blue">'C'</font>, the next 100 characters of the listing, show the input line.  
If the line is longer than 100 characters additional unnumbered lines will display the overflow.
<p>
The line following line 342 above shows the format of error, warning, and information messages.  
<font color="blue">'D'</font> is the source line number.  
<font color="blue">'E'</font> is the severity and message number (xxxyyy)
'xxx' is 'INF' for information-only messages as shown, 
'WRN' for warnings, and 'ERR' for errors. 'yyy' is a unique message identifier for this error. 
<font color="blue">'F'</font> is the message text.
<p>Currently messages generated by the parser appear intermixed in the source listing, while code
generator messages appear at the end of the source, or intermixed in the object code listing if
one is produced.  In a future version all messages will appear at the end.  Due to parsing considerations
the error message may appear one line before or after the line it references.  

<p>
<b>Source listing with nesting levels:</b><br>
If the compiler option "-ln" is specified the source listing will include
information on statement nesting within package/procedure/block and DO-Group.
<pre><tt>
    1       pk: package;
    2  1      p1: proc;
    3  2        i = 0;

    5  2  1       i = i+1;

    9  3        end p2;
   10  2      end p1;
   11  1      end pk;
</tt></pre>
The first number following the line number is the block level, 1 for the 
outermost - statements within package pk, 2 for statements within procedure p1, etc. The second
number is the depth of nesting of Do-Groups in a block, 1 for statements
immediately contained in the DO on line 4, increasing for each nested DO.

<a name='asml'>
<b>Assembly listing:</b><br>
If the -lm option is specified, a listing of the generated code will appear after the source listing.
This is similar in format to the listing generated by MASM or ALP.  The major difference
is that ALP displays immediate operands in big-endian order.  This listing will always display 
immediate operands <i>as they are stored in memory</i>, i.e. little-endian. Note that the
assembly code shown is for illustrative purposes and may or may not be assembleable
by any particular assembler.
<p>Here is a small sample of the assembly listing:

<b>Object output:</b><br>
Compiling a program xxx.pli with the -C option will create an object file xxx.obj for OMF-format

The source statement and line number that generated each piece of code, along with
the statement type is shown as indicated.  The line number ties this code to the source

<h5>Program Structure</h5>
The generated program consists of a single code segment(.text) identified by the

 identified by <b>'_pli_data'</b>, a single static unitialized data segment 
 (.bss, <b>'_pli_bss'</b>), an unnamed stack segment for OS/2, 
 and zero or more external common segments.  
<p>
External segments are generated for each variable or structure declared EXTERNAL, as well as for
each EXTERNAL FILE.  If the variable has the INITIAL attribute the data is always generated, otherwise the
declared amount of storage is reserved.  Here is the generated code for an uninitialized
external structure named 'abc':
<pre><tt>
ABC segment dword common 'ABC'
_ABC equ $
 org _ABC+0Ch
ABC ends
</tt></pre>
Here is the code for the initialized external segment 'sysprint':
<pre><tt>
SYSPRINT segment dword common 'SYSPRINT'
_SYSPRINT equ $
 dd 0
 dd 0
 dd _SYSPRINT+12
 dw 8
 db 'SYSPRINT'
SYSPRINT ends
</tt></pre>
The linker combines identically-named external segments.  The resulting length
will be the length of the largest such segment. All declarations of EXTERNAL data should be identical in length. 
It is permissible to have only one declaration of EXTERNAL data have the INITIAL attribute, and
all procedures declaring it will reference that data. If the initial values of the
elements differ between declarations the results are unpredictable. 
<font color="red">Warning:</font> The Gnu linker has a bug linking addresses
declared with the INITIAL attribute in external data. Only <u>one</u> such  
declaration can have the INITIAL attribute. The linker will add together the
values of all initialized addresses.

<b>Compiler Work File:</b><br>
The compiler creates a temporary work file named PLI-xxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyy-zzzzzzzz.tmp,
in the current working directory on OS/2, or the /tmp directory on Linux.
Normally this file is deleted at the end
of compilation.  Errors in the compiler causing 
certain traps may prevent automatic deletion of this file.  
If it not automatically removed it may be deleted manually.

<p>
<h4>Syntax Chart Format</h4>
In the syntax charts that follow, the characters '-', '.', '+', 'v', '^', '|', '&lt;', and '&gt;' are used only for
drawing the chart, and are not part of the syntax.  Other punctuation such as parentheses, semicolons, commas,
 etc. must be entered as shown.Words shown in <i>CAPITALS</i> are PL/I keywords.
Words shown in <i>lower-case</i> represent names chosen by the programmer or variable information.
(The actual case of the word in the program is not significant.)
'&gt;&gt;' identifies the beginning of a diagram, and '&gt;&lt;' represents the end. 
Entities appearing in '|' data '|' represent a syntax fragment that is expanded later.
Elements on the main line of the diagram as '--- stuff ---' are <i>required</i>.  Elements appearing above or 
below the main line represent <i>choices</i>. Elements shown all below the line are optional with no default.
Where one element is shown above the line it represents the default if none of the choices is specified.

  +------- , ----------------+
  v                          |
|-.- parameter-description --+----|
</tt></pre>
Each <i>parameter-description</i> supplies the attributes for one parameter, therefore the entry expects as many 
arguments as there are items in the list.  A parameter-description is a list of data attributes that describes that parameter.  For example:
<tt>FIXED BINARY(7)</tt>, <tt>CHARACTER(8)</tt>, <tt>POINTER</tt>, or <tt>ENTRY</tt> would all be valid parameter descriptions.
<p>
<pre><tt>
|returns-opt|

|-- RETURNS ( returns-description ) ---|
</tt></pre>
The <i>returns-description</i> describes the attributes of the data which will be returned by this entry
if it is invoked as a function.  If the <i>returns-opt</i> is omitted the attributes are determined by the
first character name of the first or only name prefix &mdash; I thru N: FIXED BINARY(15), other: FLOAT DECIMAL(6).

                v              |
|---- OPTIONS ( . entry-option +  ) ---|
</tt></pre>
Each <i>entry-option</i> is one of the following:
<dl>
<dt>FROMALIEN<dd>Indicates that this entry may be called from a non-PL/I program.  <b>A FROMALIEN
procedure should be considered to be <i>non-nested</i> &mdash;  that is, it may not access any AUTOMATIC
data in the containing procedures, if any.  Also, any condition-handling established in a
previously-called procedure will be ignored on entry to the FROMALIEN procedure.</b><p>
<dt>LINKAGE( linkage-type )<dd>'linkage-type' indicates the type of calling sequence with which
this entry will be invoked.  If LINKAGE is omitted, a standard PL/I convention will be used.
(see <a href="#rt">Run-time Considerations</a>).  
Currently the only valid linkage type is SYSTEM.   
This can be used to call functions written in C, including OS/2 API functions, 
but is also a valid  convention among PL/I procedures, with some restrictions.<br>
For source compatibility with IBM PL/I for OS/2, specify 
'OPTIONS( <u><b>BYVALUE</b></u> LINKAGE(SYSTEM) )'.
<i>BYVALUE</i> is assumed by this compiler and the keyword is ignored, but IBM PL/I defaults 
to <i>BYADDR</i> unless otherwise specified.<p>
 <tt>LINKAGE(OPTLINK)</tt>
will be implemented in a future version to specify the "Optlink" calling convention that uses
registers for some arguments.<p>

<dt>MAIN<dd>Indicates that this is the initial or 'main' procedure.  Iron Spring PL/I allows only one
OPTIONS(MAIN) procedure to be included in an executable program.
<p>
<dt>REENTRANT<dd>This is included for compatibility only.  All code compiled by Iron Spring PL/I is reentrant.
</dl>
<p>
RECURSIVE is supported for compatibility only.  It indicates that this entry may call itself, either directly
or indirectly through a chain of calls.  Iron Spring PL/I assumes all entries are potentially recursive.
<p>

               |                      |
               +- ( external-name ) --+
</tt></pre>
The <i>external-name</i> is a character string, enclosed in quotes, representing the name by
which this entry will be known to external callers.
External 'external-name's beginning with the string "_pli" are reserved for use by the
run-time library.  If the 'external-name' is not specified, the default external name is
an uppercase translation of the first label on the external procedure or entry
statement.  For example,
<tt>x: y: PROCEDURE;</tt> will use "X" as the external name for the linker.
<p>
<h5>ENTRY Declarations</h5>
The following attributes can be used in the declaration of an external entry:
<pre><tt>
DECLARE-- decl-name --ENTRY-+--------------------+-+-----------------+-+-----------------+-+------------------+-- ; ><
                            |                    | |                 | |                 | |                  |
                            +-| ( parameters ) |-+ +-| returns-opt |-+ +-| options-opt |-+ +-| external-opt |-+
</tt></pre>
Parameters, returns-opt, and external-opt are described under "PROCEDURE and ENTRY Statements" above.  
An entry declared <i>without</i> a parameter list &mdash; <tt>DECLARE a ENTRY;</tt> will accept any
number of arguments with no conversion.  An entry declared with an <i>empty</i> parameter list &mdash;
<tt>DECLARE a ENTRY();</tt> does not allow any arguments.
<pre><tt>

</tt></pre>
The following options are valid for entry declarations:
<dl>
<dt>ASSEMBLER (abbreviated ASM)<dd>Indicates that the entry is a non-PL/I procedure (assembler, C, etc.)  
The compiler generates code to save and restore the x87 Floating-point control word, since programs 
in different languages may change this unpredictably.

A package is a block which can immediately contain only declarations, DEFAULT statements, and PROCEDURE blocks.
The package forms a name scope that is shared by all declarations and procedures it contains.  Some or all
of the level-1 procedures can be exported and made known outside the package as external procedures.
<dl>
<dt>EXPORTS<dd>Specifies that all [EXPORTS(*)] or the named procedures are to be made known outside the
package.  Procedures not exported are known only within the package.  If the EXPORTS keyword is not
specified, EXPORTS(*) is assumed.
<dt>RESERVES<dd>This keyword is not used by the Iron Spring compiler, and is treated as comments only due
to differences in handling initialized and uninitialized EXTERNAL data.
<dt>OPTIONS<dd>This keyword is not used by the Iron Spring compiler, and is treated as comments only for
compatibility with other compilers.
</dl>
<p>
All declarations with package scope (outside of procedures within the package) must have STATIC, BASED, 
CONTROLLED, or EXTERNAL storage class, AUTOMATIC data is not allowed outside of procedures.

<h5>File Declarations</h5>
The general form of a file declaration is shown below.  As usual, keywords can be specified in any order.  Many
keywords may be specified either in the declaration or in the <b>OPEN</b> statement for the file.  If they are
specified in both, they must not conflict.  For example, a file declared <b>INPUT</b> cannot be opened as <b>OUTPUT</b>
or the UNDEFINEDFILE condition will raised when the file is opened.

<ul>
<li><a name="fn">"name" is the name by which the file is known to the PL/I program.  It must follow the rules for PL/I
identifiers.
<li><a name="f">The keyword <b>FILE</b> is required if none of the other file declaration keywords are coded.  Otherwise it
is implied.
</ul>

<a name="rs">
<p>
<h5>RECORD and STREAM Files</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>STREAM</b> indicates that the file is a <i>continuous stream</i> of data items in character form.  <b>STREAM</b> files
are read or written without regard to record boundaries.  The PL/I statements <b>GET</b> and <b>PUT</b> are used to 
process <b>STREAM</b> files.<br>
<li><b>RECORD</b> indicates that the file is logically divided into <i>records</i> which are composed of one
or more data items in any form.  A <i>record</i> is always read or written as a unit.  The PL/I statements <b>READ</b>,
<b>WRITE</b>, <b>REWRITE</b>, and <b>LOCATE</b> are used to process <b>RECORD</b> files.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="iou">
<p>
<h5>INPUT, OUTPUT, and UPDATE</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>INPUT</b> indicates that the file is to be read only.  The file must exist or the UNDEFINEDFILE condition will
be raised when the file is opened.
<li><b>OUTPUT</b> indicates that the file is to be written only.  If the file does not exist, it will be created when
opened.  If it does exist, it will be deleted and a new file created, unless the <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> option <b>APPEND</b>
is specified.
<li><b>UPDATE</b> indicates that the file is going to be both read and written.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="e">
<p>
<h5>ENVIRONMENT Options</h5>
The <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> attribute allows specification of implementation-dependent options for a file.
Iron Spring PL/I allows coding of all <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> attributes allowed by <i>IBM PL/I for MVS and VM</i>.
Only attributes actually used are described here.

<ul>

<li>Record format keywords: <b>D, DB, F, FB, FS, FBS, V, VB, VS, VBS, U</b>.<br>
One of these keywords is coded to indicate the type of records to be processed.  
Only the <b>D, F, V, and U</b> are significant, the others
are provided for compatibility.  <b>F</b> indicates that the file consists of records having all
the same length.  <b>V</b> or <b>D</b> indicate that the records in the file can have different lengths.<p>
The options <b>TEXT</b>, <b>CRLF</b>, <b>LF</b>, and <b>VARLS</b> provide additional information about the external 
representation of <b>F, V, and D</b> files.
<p>
Record format <b>U</b> allows reading and writing files without regard to formatting or record boundaries.
When reading <b>INTO</b> a character string, the amount of data available up to the maximum 
length of the string is returned.  ENDFILE is raised only on the <i>next</i> read after the last byte has been returned.
See the sample program 'readu.pli' for an example of using <b>ENV(U)</b> to read a file with no
predetermined maximum record length.  Writing <b>FROM</b> a character string writes <i>n</i> bytes of data from the
string, where <i>n</i> is the current or constant length of the string.

<li><b>BLKSIZE(n)</b> specifies the size of the buffer used to transfer data 
to or from the file or device.
If this keyword is not specified, a default value is used.

<li><b>RECSIZE(n)</b> specifies the uniform record length for <b>F</b> files, or the maximum record length for
<b>V or D</b> files.  If this keyword is not specified, the default is <b>LINESIZE</b>.  The <b>RECSIZE</b> value 
describes only the data portion of the record, exclusive of delimiters, length prefixes, etc.

<li><b>TEXT</b>, <b>CRLF</b> or <b>LF</b> specifies the presence of record delimiters.
If none of the three options is specified, no delimiters will be written on output or expected on input. 
<b>TEXT</b> indicates that the default record delimiter for the system will be used: 
CRLF for OS/2 or LF for Linux.  The <b>TEXT</b> option should be used in preference to either <b>CRLF</b> or
<b>LF</b> unless a specific delimiter is required, since code specifying <b>TEXT</b> is portable.  
<b>LF</b> indicates that a single newline character (ASCII '0A'x)
delimits records in the file (Unix convention).  <b>CRLF</b> indicates that a carriage-return/linefeed combination
(ASCII '0D0A'x) is used as a delimiter (OS/2, DOS convention).  The delimiters will be written as specified on output, but 
either is always acceptable for input.

<li><b>VARLS</b> specifies that records in the file will be written with a FIXED BINARY(15) prefix containing the
length of the following data.

<li><b>APPEND</b> specifies that an <b>INPUT</b> or <b>UPDATE</b> file will have data appended to the end if it
already exists.  When the file is opened, the current file position will be set to the end of the file.

</ul>
<p>

<a name="o">
<p>
<h5>Other Attributes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Storage attributes <b>ALIGNED, UNALIGNED, AUTOMATIC, BASED, DEFINED, STATIC, INTERNAL, and EXTERNAL</b>  may be
used with declarations of <i>file variables</i>.  <b>INTERNAL and EXTERNAL</b> are also applicable to <i>file constants</i>.
The default for a <i>file constant</i> is <b>EXTERNAL</b>.  A <i>file constant</i> declared INTERNAL
is automatically made STATIC.
<li><b>BUFFERED</b> or <b>UNBUFFERED</b> are used to control the amount of storage that will be used for buffers 
for this file.  <b>BUFFERED</b> requests that a storage area of length <i>BLKSIZE</i> is to be used to handle
transfers to or from the file or device, minimizing interaction with the Operating System.  <b>UNBUFFERED</b> specifies
that each record is read or written immediately, and no additional storage is used.
<li><b>KEYED</b> indicates that <i>keys</i> may be used to select a particular record to be read or written, bypassing
normal sequential processing.  A <i>key</i> for this implementation is a CHARACTER(12) data item which uniquely identifies
a record in the file.  This is not intended to be user-modifiable data, except that key of (12)'00'x indicates the beginning
of the file, and (12)'FF'x indicates the end. The <b>KEY</b>, <b>KEYFROM</b>, and <b>KEYTO</b> keywords may be used 
on I/O statements to receive or supply the identifier of the record.<br>
<i>This implementation of KEYED is unique to Iron Spring PL/I.</i>
<li><b>PRINT</b> is an additional attribute for <b>STREAM OUTPUT</b> files indicating that this file is ultimately
destined to be printed.  The compiler keeps track of the current "page" and "line" in the file, and raises the 
<b>ENDPAGE</b> condition when starting a new page.  <b>PRINT</b> also enables print-related processing of the <b>PAGE</b> 
option on the <b>PUT</b> statement and the <b>PAGE</b> format item.
Specifying <b>PAGESIZE(0)</b> on the <b>OPEN</b> statement will
suppress page breaks for <b>PRINT</b> files.See <a href="#plitabs">PLITABS</a>.
<li><b>VARIABLE</b> indicates that this declaration is a <i>file variable</i> rather than a <i>file constant</i>.  
<i>File variables</i> can be assigned the value of a <i>file constant</i> at run time, for example, to pass a file 
as a parameter to a procedure, but cannot be used for I/O unless a value has been assigned.  
</ul>
<p>
<b>STREAM</b> files default to <b>ENV(V TEXT)</b> unless other attributes are specified.  <b>RECORD</b> <b>ENV(V)</b>
files default to <b>ENV(V VARLS)</b>.  
<p>

<h5>Standard Files</h5>

Unless overridden by <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> or <b>OPEN</b>, the
standard files SYSIN and SYSPRINT default to stdin and stdout with the following attributes
respectively.
<table border=1>
<tr><td>SYSIN</td><td>ENV(V TEXT RECSIZE120))</td></tr>
<tr><td>SYSPRINT</td><td>PRINT ENV(V TEXT RECSIZE(120)) LINESIZE(120) PAGESIZE(60)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>If stdin and stdout are the current terminal(VIO) window, these files default
to ENV( BLKSIZE(0) ).
</table>

<h5>Interactive options</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>ENVIRONMENT(INTERACTIVE)</b> Specifying the "INTERACTIVE" environment 
option for a STREAM OUTPUT file forces the file to be UNBUFFERED and will 
immediately write each output data item followed by a new line.  
This will cause prompts to be
written immediately rather than buffered.  Normally a complete line is accumulated 
and only written when a SKIP, PAGE, or COL which forces a line advance is written.
<li><b>L-Format item</b> On input the L-Format item will read all characters up to 
the end of the current line and assign it to the corresponding data list item,
converting as necessary.
On output the current item will be converted to character and written, padded
on the right with blanks if necessary to fill the current line.  The current line 
will then be written.  Declaring output files UNBUFFERED may be required to insure
the completed line is not buffered. 

<p>
<a name="stmt">
<h5>Input/Output Statements</h5>
<b>OPEN</b> and <b>CLOSE</b> apply to both <b>STREAM</b> and <b>RECORD</b> files.  The <b>GET</b> and <b>PUT</b>
statements operate on <b>STREAM</b> files.  The <b>READ</b>, <b>WRITE</b>, <b>REWRITE</b>, and <b>LOCATE</b>
statements operate on <b>RECORD</b> files.  The assumption is made that the reader is familiar with, or has access
to a reference for, the I/O statements of <i>IBM PL/I for MVS and VM</i>.  Only the syntax accepted by Iron Spring
PL/I is shown here, no explanation is provided.

<a name="t">
The <b>TITLE(string)</b> option provides the operating system "filespec" of the file to be read or written.
"String" is any valid character string expression.
If the <b>TITLE</b> is omitted, the file name used by the system will be the declared PL/I filename

<a name="stream">
<b>GET EDIT compatibility</b><br>
STREAM INPUT data for Linux or OS/2 normally consists of variable-length 
lines with LF or CRLF delimiters.
Many existing IBM mainframe PL/I programs make the assumption that these records 
are fixed card images, 80 characters long. Therefore you may see code like the following:
<pre><tt>    DECLARE card CHARACTER(80);
    GET EDIT(card)(A(80));</tt></pre>
With this code Iron Spring PL/I will attempt to read 80 characters from SYSIN,
ignoring record boundaries, and will garble the input stream.
<p>
To ensure that record boundaries are observed, code the GET statement as:
<pre><tt>    GET EDIT(card)(A);</tt></pre>
WITHOUT the length specification. In this case a maximum of one record will 
be read for each GET, and the resulting data assigned to "card" left-justified 
and space-filled, which is probably what the program expects.
<p>
Alternatively, a program "encard" is supplied in the "samples" directory which 
will expand a text file to 80-byte records with blank padding, so that standard
Linux or OS/2 files can be used with unmodified PL/I programs expecting card
 images. 
You can use "encard" run your program with a command simular to:
<pre><tt>encard&lt;YOUR.DATASET|YOUR.PROGRAM</pre></tt> 
"encard" should point to the directory where you have placed the compiled program, 
for esample "/usr/local/bin/encard", or "~/bin/encard" (if in your home
directory). replace YOUR.DATASET and YOUR.PROGRAM with the name of the input dataset
and the full pathname of the program you want to run, respectively.

<a name="plitabs">
<p>
The <b>PLITABS</b> structure provides a description of a printed page used by the I/O routines. 
A definition of this structure is provided in "lib\include\plitabs.inc."  This defines the pagesize 
and linesize used for PRINT files, and the tab positions for list-directed and data-directed output.
If PLITABS is not used the defaults are PAGESIZE(60) LINESIZE(120) and four tabs at columns 
25, 49, 73, and 97, the same as the defaults for the IBM compilers.  To change these values include
the PLITABS structure in your program and set the desired values before opening any PRINT files.
Space is reserved for up to 255 tab values.

"expression" is converted to a character string and written to stderr.  If the "reply" option
is not specified, this is followed by a newline.  If the "reply" option
is specified it must be a character reference which will receive the 
response from stderr.<p>
The "event" option is currently ignored, and the 
statement is executed synchronously; control does not return until the
response has been read.

If the "display" expression ends with a '$' neither the '$' nor the newline 
will be displayed. This allows output from multiple display statements to 
appear on one line.

<!------ Multitasking ----->
<a name="mt">
<p>
<h4>Multitasking</h4>
The Compiler currently supports the "multitasking" API <u>similar to</u> IBM PL/I
for MVS and VM.  "Multithreading", as supported by IBM Enterprise PL/I,
will be implemented in a future release.  Iron Spring PL/I will then 
continue to support both feature sets.
<p>
The multitasking API adds a TASK data attribute, the
TASK, EVENT, and PRIORITY options of the CALL statement, and the
PRIORITY builtin function and pseudovariable.  The EVENT attribute and
the builtins/pseudovariables COMPLETION and STATUS, and the WAIT
statement, which IBM does not consider part of the multitasking
feature, are also documented here.
<ul>
<li>The multitasking CALL is indicated by the appearance of one or more
of the following options on a call statement:
<pre><tt>
  TASK (task reference)
  EVENT (event reference)
  PRIORITY (expression)
</tt></pre>
The task priority is currently determined by the operating system, so the TASK and
PRIORITY options are otherwise ignored.  If the EVENT option is coded, the
event variable referenced will be set to incomplete (COMPLETION='0'b) by the  
call, and will be set to complete (COMPLETION='1'b) when the subtask terminates.
<li>COMPLETION builtin function and pseudovariable:<br>
An event variable may be in one of two states, incomplete or complete.  The COMPLETION
pseudovariable is used to set the state, assigning an expression to it which 
evaluates to '0'b for incomplete or '1'b for complete.  The COMPLETION builtin
function returns the state of the event as a bit(1) value.  assigning
COMPLETION(e)='1'b will wake up any tasks waiting on event e.
<li>The WAIT statement will cause the current task to wait for completion of
an event.<br>
The syntax of the WAIT statement is
<pre><tt>
>>-WAIT (event reference)-- ; --><
</tt></pre>
IBM PL/I will allow a task to wait for completion of multiple events.  Iron
Spring PL/I currently allows waiting for one.  It the event is complete, the wait
statement is a no-operation.  If the event is incomplete, the task will be
suspended until completion.<p>
EVENT variables are always initialized to COMPLETION='0'b and STATUS=0. (exception, for EVENT variables in an array
of structures only the first occurrence will be initialized). If event variables
are reused they must be reinitialized prior to use.
</ul> 
Tasks constitute a hierarchical structure with the initial task of the procedure,
the "major task", at the root.  If the major task "A" attaches tasks "B" and "C",
these are then subtasks of "A".  If subtask "B" attaches task "D", "D" is 
then a subtask of "B" and so on.  When a task terminates, any subtasks which
are not complete will be terminated.  Otherwise a task will terminate when
any of the following occurs:
<ul>
<li>Control reaches a RETURN or END for the initial procedure of the task.
<li>The task executes an EXIT statement.
<li>Implicit action for the ERROR condition or normal return from an
ERROR On-unit in the task.
<li>The block in which the task was attached terminates.
</ul>
Execution of a STOP statement in any task will terminate the major task 
and all subtasks.
<p>
<b>Multitasking considerations:</b>
<ul>
<li>IBM PL/I frees all storage allocated by a subtask and closes all files 
opened by the subtask when the subtask terminates.  Currently Iron Spring
PL/I does not do this, although that will be implemented in a future
release.  In the meantime a task should close its own files if desired and free any 
storage it allocates.
<li>Access to memory shared between tasks should be controlled by mutex 
semaphores unless the memory is truely read-only by all tasks.
See <a href="#lib">User-callable library procedures</a> for mutex semaphore procedures.
<li>Memory caching and
cache coherence is handled differently by various CPUs and PL/I multitasking 
has been tested on only a small number.  To report bugs related to multitasking 
please include CPU information such as can be obtained from Linux 
"About this Computer."  
<li>All PL/I library procedures should be <i>thread-safe</i>.  If a subtask calls 
subroutines written in other languages, it is the programmer's responsibility to
insure that they are thread-safe.
</ul>

<!------ IBM-format packed decimal data ----->
<a name="ibm">
<p>
<h4>IBM-format packed decimal data</h4>
IBM mainframe PL/I stores FIXED DECIMAL data as"packed decimal", 
big-endian two digits per byte with a trailing sign.  Signs 'A'x, 'C'x, 'E'x 
and 'F'x indicate positive numbers; 'B'x and 'D'x are negative.  Packed
decimal numbers can be up to 16 digits.
<p>
Iron Spring PL/I supports this format for compatibility purposes, for 
data transfer to and from mainframe systems.  To declare a packed decimal
field the attributes are <tt>FIXED DECIMAL(p[,q]) OPTIONS(IBM)</tt> where 
p and q are the precision and scale as usual. The field will occupy ceil((p+1)/2) bytes
with byte alignment only. OPTIONS(IBM) may be specified on a major or minor
structure to indicate that all FIXED DECIMAL data in the structure is in packed format.
<p>
Use of IBM-format packed decimal data for other than input and output is 
<u><b>not recommended</b></u>, because this data is converted by a library procedure 
each time it is used. Move packed decimal data to and from standard FIXED DECIMAL fields
(without "OPTIONS(IBM)") before using in computations.
<p>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
<pre><tt>DECLARE x FIXED DEC(7) STATIC INIT( 443322 ) OPTIONS(IBM);</tt></pre>
will generate a four byte field containing '0443322C'x.

<h4>Additional Builtin Functions and Pseudovariables</h4>
This section lists only builtins in Iron Spring PL/I either not present in 
IBM PL/I for MVS and VM or implemented differently.  
The definitions are taken from IBM PL/I for OS/2 [OS2], IBM Enterprise PL/I [ENT], VAX PL/I [VAX], 
Multics PL/I [Multics], or ANSI PL/I [ANSI].

  <tr valign=top><td><b>AFTER(s,c)&nbsp;</b></td><td>AFTER returns a nonvarying string containing all
  the characters or bits in the string value of "s" that follow the first occurrence of the string
  value of "c".
  If "c" does not occur within "s", if "s" is the null string, or if no 
  characters or bits in "s" follow "c", the result is the null string. 
  If "c" is the null string the result is "s".

  value of "c".
  If "c" does not occur within "s", if "s" is the null string, or if no 
  characters or bits in "s" precede "c", the result is the null string.  
  If "c" is the null string the result is the null string.

    CENTERLEFT returns a character string of length y, with character
    string x centered (or one position to the left of center), 
    padded on the ends with the character z as needed. 
    Y must be able to be converted to a FIXED BINARY value. Z should be
    a single character.

    FIXED BINARY(31) value indicating whether or not the exchange was accomplished.
    q is a pointer expression which yields the address of a FIXED BINARY(31) variable q' 
    to be set by the exchange,
    p is a pointer expression which yields the address of a FIXED BINARY(31) variable p' 
    which is to be compared with q',
    and x is an expression which yields the new FIXED BINARY(31) <u>value</u> to be set.  
    If p' and q' are equal x replaces q',  and the CS builtin returns 0 (success). 
    If they are unequal q' replaces p' [to set up for another call to CS] and the builtin 
    returns 1 (failure).  
    This provides an atomic "compare and swap" operation for thread or process synchronization.

    representation of 'y' bytes of storage at location 'x'.  If 'z' is omitted, the length of the returned
    string is 2*y.  If 'z' is present it must be CHARACTER(1) nonvarying, and the value of 'z' is inserted 
    between every set of eight characters in the output string.  In this case the length of the returned

  <tr valign=top><td><b>IBSW(n)&nbsp;</b></td><td>IBSW returns a FIXED BIN(32) UNSIGNED value obtained
    by swapping the bytes in its argument, n. The argument is converted to UNSIGNED FIXED BINARY(32) 
    using the normal rules of PL/I and the bytes are swapped to reverse the endianness. This builtin is 
    not available with any other PL/I compiler.

    of 'x' with all leading characters in the character value of 'y' trimmed.  If 'y' 
    is omitted a string consisting of a single blank character is used.  If 'y' is the
    null string no trimming occurs.  If 'x' is the null string a null string is returned.
    [Multics][VAX]
    <br>&nbsp;
    </td></tr>    

  <tr valign=top><td><b>MAXLENGTH(x)&nbsp;</b></td><td>MAXLENGTH returns the maximum length of the
    string value of "x".  "x" must be computational; if it is not a string it is
    converted to a <u>CHARACTER</u> string before the length is calculated.  This is different 
    from the LENGTH builtin that converts BINARY arguments to <u>BIT</u> strings, but is
    consistent with IBM Enterprise PL/I. [OS2][ENT][VAX]

  <tr valign=top><td><b>POLY(x,y)&nbsp;</b></td><td>POLY forms a polynomial expansion from its arguments.
    x must be a one-dimensional array (vector), y may be a vector or a scalar element.
    the result is x1 + x2*y1 + x3*(y1*y2)... <br>
    If y is a scalar, its value is reused, giving x1 + x2*y + x3*y**2 ...<br>
    If there are more elements in y than x, the excess will be ignored. If there
    are fewer, the last element will be reused as needed.
    x and y must be computational, and will be converted to FLOAT. The result is FLOAT with the
    base and mode determined by the rules for expression evaluation, and the
    precision of the longest argument.
    <p>
    This is an IBM-only builtin function, and various IBM compilers function
    differently; in particular, several only allow y to be a scalar.

    between 0e0 and 1e0 as a FLOAT BINARY(52) value.  "s" is an optional 
    <i>seed</i> to start or restart the
    sequence. The value of "s" will be converted to FIXED BINARY(31). If "s" is omitted the number returned is based on the seed 
    generated by the previous call, or 1 if a seed was never specified.  "s" must be
    greater than zero and less than 2,147,483,646 or the ERROR condition will be
    raised. RANDOM maintains one seed per program, regardless of the number of tasks.
    <br>
    RANDOM uses the "multiplicative congruential method" (compatible with IBM
    Enterprise PL/I) to generate values:<br><tt>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seed(x)   = mod( 950706376 * seed(x-1), 2147483647 )<br>

    ROUND returns the value of x rounded in the y'th digit.
    If y is zero the last digit is rounded. The result has
    the same base, scale, and mode as x.
    <p>
    If x is FLOAT, ROUND functions the same as in IBM Enterprise PL/I
    with the option "USAGE(ROUND(IBM))", that is, it is a no-op, and
    x is returned.

    SEARCH returns the position in the
    character value of of 'x' of the first matching character in the 
    character value of 'y'. Characters in 'y' are taken left to right, 
    and the position of the first match in 'x' is returned.  
    If 'x' or 'y' is the null string or if none
    of the characters in 'y' occurs in 'x', zero is returned.

      'x' is reference to a variable that is suitable for bit-string or character-string

       'x' must be a reference to a variable that is suitable for character-string (or bit-string)
       overlay defining.

       'x' must designate one of the following:
       <ul>
         <li>A scalar string variable.
         <li>An aggregate variable whose components are all string variables of one
            type (either 'character' or 'bit', but not a mixture of 'character'

            by 'x' is m, then the pseudovariable is interpreted as follows:
            <p>
     The value assigned to the pseudovariable is converted to
     'bit(m)' or 'char(m)', depending on the type of 'x'. If 'x' is a 
     scalar varying string, the result is varying, otherwise it is a 
     fixed-length string.<br>

<h4>The PLISRTx builtins</h4>
Iron Spring PL/I provides builtin functions to perform a sort function.
These are similar, but not exactly identical, to the corresponding routines
supplied by IBM PL/I.  <b>Only the function PLISRTD is currently available</b> to 
perform a sort of data supplied by a user-written procedure and passing
 sorted data to a second user-written procedure.  Iron Spring PLISRTD
 performes an in-memory sort, so sufficient storage must be available.
 Full documentation of PLISRTD is available in the document

<p>
Syscall is called with a variable number of arguments, and returns either a
FIXED BINARY(31) value or a POINTER, depending on the specific call.  The first 
argument is always the call number.  A description of Linux system calls is
beyond the scope of this <i>Guide</i>.  Zero to six additional arguments for
the call may be provided, all either FIXED BINARY(31) or POINTER.  The kernel
returns a single result or an errno.  If the call returns an error, the result 
is the negative value of "errno".
If a POINTER result is expected use the PTRVALUE builtin to convert from 
FIXED BINARY to POINTER.

<!------ Preprocessor Facilities ----->
<a name="pre">
<p>
<h4>Preprocessor Facilities</h4>
<i>This section describes the preprocessor facilities currently built in
to the compiler. The beta version of the full preprocessor is described
elsewhere.</i><p>
The current built-in preprocessor is limited to a subset of the IBM preprocessor statements.
The listing control statements %PAGE, %SKIP, %PRINT, and %NOPRINT, the %INCLUDE statement,
and the %REPLACE statement are described below.<p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">%INCLUDE:</td>
<td>The %INCLUDE statement instructs the compiler to read an external file of text and insert its
    contents in place of the %INCLUDE.  The syntax is: "%INCLUDE &lt;filespec&gt;;".<br>
    &lt;filespec&gt; is any valid file specification.  If no file extension is coded the
    compiler will search for files having the extensions ".cpy", ".inc", or no extension.  The
    search path for the file is specified on the PLIC command (see <a href="#run">Running the compiler</a>).
<p>
    When running on Linux, the compiler will first search for an exact case match; if not found the first
    matching file in any case will be included.
    Examples of the %INCLUDE statement are:<pre><tt>
    %INCLUDE ABC; [will include "ABC", "ABC.CPY", or "ABC.INC" in your search path -
               on Linux, if no file ABC[.x] is found, will include the first
               found of Abc[.x], abc[.x], etc.]
    %INCLUDE "def.pli"; [will include "DEF.PLI" in your search path]
    %INCLUDE "c:\pli\includes\ghi.pl1"; [will include the named file only]
</tt></pre>
<p>
    Nested includes are allowed, that is, the included file may itself contain %INCLUDE statements.
    The maximum depth of nesting is four levels.
<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">%REPLACE:</td>
<td>The %REPLACE preprocessor statement provides limited text substitution
    capability.  The syntax is "%REPLACE &lt;identifier&gt; BY &lt;constant&gt;;".<br>
    &lt;identifier&gt; is any word which would be valid as an identifier in a PL/I program.
    <u>PL/I keywords are not allowed</u>.  Multiple %REPLACE statements may 
    specify the same identifier, with the most recently-occurring one being in effect.
    &lt;constant&gt; is any valid character-string, bit-string, or arithmetic constant. 
    The scope of the %REPLACE statement is between its occurrence in the input stream and
    the end of the source program, including any included files.  The effect is to substitute
    the value of &lt;constant&gt; in the program anywhere &lt;identifier&gt; appears. <p>
    For example, the following sequence of statements:
    <pre><tt> %REPLACE abc by 1;
put edit(3+abc)(f(5));</tt></pre>
    will result in the value 4 being output by the PUT statement.<p>            
    The %REPLACE statement above is equivalent to the following, but does not require a 
    full preprocessor scan:
    <pre><tt> %DECLARE abc CHARACTER;
%abc = '1';</tt></pre>
    To use a atring a replacement text, it must be enclosed in double quotation-marks.
    For example, %REPLACE some_string by "'ABC'", or %REPLACE some_string by '''ABC'''.
<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">%PRINT:</td>
<td>The %PRINT statement turns on (enables) printing of the source listing.  The %PRINT statement itself
    will not be printed if the listing was previously disabled.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">%NOPRINT:</td>
<td>The %NOPRINT statement turns off (disables) printing of the source listing.  The %NOPRINT statement
    itself will be printed if the listing was previously enabled.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">%PAGE:</td>
<td>The %PAGE statement causes a page eject in the source listing after printing of the
    %PAGE statement, if the listing is enabled.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">%SKIP:</td>
<td>The %SKIP[(n)] statement will print 'n' blank lines (n=1 to 9) in the source listing following
    the printing of the %SKIP statement, if the listing is enabled.  If 'n' is omitted, the default
    is one line.<p></td></tr> 
<tr><td valign="top">%CONTROL:</td>

<h4>Run-time considerations</h4>

<!------ Accessing unprocessed command arguments ----->
<a name="argc">
<p>
<h5>Accessing unprocessed command arguments</h5>
Iron Spring PL/I converts command-line arguments passed by the Linux shell into a varying 
character string for compatibility with other PL/I compilers. To access the 
unprocessed argc and argv information include the member "argc.inc" from the
PL/I runtime library. For OS/2, COMMAND.EXE provides only the program name and
the unparsed argument string only as arguments.
<pre>     /* %include argc.inc includes the following declarations */
     dcl 1 argc_s             ext( '_pli_argc' ),
          5 argc              fixed bin(31),      /* Arg count        */
          5 ppargv            ptr,                /* **argv           */
          5 ppenv             ptr;                /* **envp           */
         
     dcl arg_addr        (0:1)ptr        based;   /* *argv[]          */
</pre>


<h5>Run-time messages</h5>
All run-time messages are written to stderr:
<ul>
<li><tt>cccc condition raised at address aaaa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in procedure with entry eeee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[at line number nnnn in compile unit pppppppp]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thread =           tttt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[variable information]</tt><br>
Issued by: _pli_SIG<br>
Cause: Condition "cccc" was raised, either by a PL/I SIGNAL statement or by
the occurrence of an error. "aaaa" is the address where the error occurred,
"eeee" is the name of the active entry in the procedure in which
the error occurred.
<br>
The next line is displayed only if the program was compiled with the "-N" 
option. "nnnn" is the source line number where the error occurred, and "pppppppp"
is the external procedure or package name .
<br>
"tttt" is the id of the thread in which the error occurred.<p>
The "variable information" differs depending on the condition and the
operating system.<br>
<ul>
<li><tt>condition=xxxx</tt><br>
If the condition was CONDITION(name), xxxx is the 
name of the user-defined condition.
<li><tt>ONFILE=ffff</tt><br>
If the error is associated with an
input-output statement, "ffff" is the name of the file.
<li><tt>System Code=hhhhhhhh tttttttt</tt><br>
For OS/2 system exceptions, "hhhhhhhh" and "tttttttt" are the hexadecimal value
and the description of the exception respectively.<br>
For Linux signals "hhhhhhhh" is the signal number, and "tttttttt" is the text description
of the signal.<p>
</ul> 
<li><tt>No WHEN clause selected in SELECT statement<br>
and no OTHERWISE clause present</tt><br>
Issued by: _pli_OTH<br>
Cause: User error.  None of the conditions specified in a
SELECT-statement were satisfied and the statement did not include an OTHERWISE.<p>
<li><tt>Unrecognized intrinsic function call</tt><br>
Issued by: _pli_IIC<br>
Cause: Either a compiler error or a mismatch between
the compiled program and the version of the runtime library used.<p>
</ul>
<p>
See <a href="#dbg">Debugging</a> for SNAP and PLIDUMP output.

<h5>The MAIN Procedure</h5>
The symbol '_pli_Main' is an alias for the first entry point of the main procedure.
The actual entry point of a PL/I program is the runtime library function '_pli_Start', which has
the alias 'main' for compatibility with C.<p>
The MAIN procedure is called with one argument: a <tt>CHARACTER(*) VARYING</tt> string containing
the [possibly edited] image of the command line that invoked the program.  Since a
"command line" as such doesn't exist for Linux, this parameter is manufactured by
concatenating all of the "argv" values, separated by spaces.
<p>
The sample program 'numwrd.pli' is an example of a program that uses the command-line.
<p>

<h5>Memory utilization</h5>
Generated PL/I code does not modify STATIC storage except during program initialization.
All code is <i>reentrant</i> unless the user program modifies STATIC storage in such
a way as to invalidate this.
<p>
PL/I programs use the stack for activation records for procedures and BEGIN-blocks, including
all AUTOMATIC storage.  The <i>heap</i> is used for all allocated BASED and CONTROLLED storage, for
control information for error-handling, and for file information and buffers.  
<p>
For OS/2 the stack size is taken
from the value stored with the executable, either by the linker, by EXEHDR, or a default minimal
value of 16K bytes.  Stack storage is allocated when the program is loaded, but is not <i>committed</i>
until actually used.  <i>Stack probes</i> are employed to prevent traps when more than 4K is requested
at one time.  Linux allows all available memory below the address where the program is loaded
to be used for stack, and doesn't require stack probes.
<p>For OS/2 the heap size is currently fixed at 1MB (1024K), although a future release will allow this value
to be respecified at run time.  In the interim, if a larger heap is required, the library procedure
INIT can be re-assembled specifying a larger value for the data item 'def_heap_size'.  Linux allows
all available memory above the end of the BSS section to be used for the heap.
<p>
The layout of the stack frame for one procedure or Begin-block is illustrated below.

<p>
<h5>Program Linkage</h5>
The standard PL/I calling sequence passes all arguments <i>by reference</i>, that is by
passing their addresses and, optionally, the addresses of their <i>descriptors</i>.  
This means that changes to the values of parameters in the called procedure are reflected back 
to the caller.
Descriptors are passed for structure, array, and string arguments;  
normally descriptors are not passed for arithmetic 
arguments, although PL/I runtime procedures may require a descriptor.  The library include
file 'desc.inc' shows the layout of descriptors for various types of data [subject to change 
in future releases].  When the argument is a constant, an expression, or
the data type doesn't match the corresponding parameter, a <i>dummy argument</i> is created
and placed on the stack; the called procedure is passed the address of the dummy. In this case,
changes to the values of parameters change the dummy argument and don't modify the actual argument.
<p>
Descriptors for non-adjustable data are normally stored in STATIC storage, descriptors for adjustable
data are created during block initialization and stored in the current stack frame.  Descriptors for
expressions whose attributes are not known at compile-time (e.g. SUBSTR(s,1,j) will be created on the
stack as required.
<p>
All arguments are pushed on the stack right to left (leftmost arguments in lower addresses).  
The last [highest-addressed] argument passed points to an area on the stack to receive a possible 
result.    The caller cleans up the argument list following return.<p>
The <i>called</i> program is responsible for saving registers EBP, and 
EBX, ESI, and EDI.  It is the <i>caller's</i> responsibility to save any other registers used.
If the called entry is specified with OPTIONS(ASM), the caller saves and restores the 80x87
FPU control register.  The calling program passes the size of the argument list in DWORDs
in AL.
<p>
Arguments for 'SYSTEM' and "OPTLINK' are passed <i>by value</i>.  
All arguments, normally limited
to arithmetic data, pointers, and nonvarying strings, are evaluated and the <i>values</i> are
passed to the called procedure; descriptors are not used. 
Changes to the values of parameters do not cause changes in
the values of the corresponding arguments.
Returned values from function procedures may be returned on the stack or in EAX or ST(0).
<p>
Two other pieces of information are also passed to a called PL/I procedure.  The <i>static backchain</i>
is passed in ESI, and the address of the <i>Program Global Table (PGT)</i> is passed in EDI.
These are passed for both "system" and PL/I linkage unless the called entry is specified with OPTIONS(ASM).
The PGT is a vector table containing the addresses of some required runtime routines.  The <i>static
backchain</i> is the EBP value of the block which <u>lexically</u> contains the called procedure.
This allows the called procedure to reference automatic data belonging to containing blocks.  This is
<u>not</u> necessarily the same as the EBP value of the caller.  For example, consider the following:
<pre><tt>
  A: PROC;
    CALL B;
    B: PROC;
      CALL B;
      C: BEGIN;
         END;
      END B;
    END A;
</tt></pre>
A is always the 'containing' block of B, regardless of whether B is called from A or from itself recursively.
B is the containing block of block C.  Using the <i>static backchain</i>, C can address AUTOMATIC data from
B and A, and so on.

<p>
The stack layout for a standard PL/I call is illustrated below.

EXTERNAL <i>data</i> (not EXTERNAL ENTRY) is not shared between executable and DLL code, nor
among procedures in different DLLs.  For example, data declared 
<tt>DECLARE a EXTERNAL POINTER;</tt> will identify different "a"s in
procedures linked into in the executable, in DLL "1", and DLL "2".  <i>Within</i> the executable 
or any one of the DLLs all occurrences of that declaration will identify the same "a".
Each level-1 external data declaration generates a segment for the linker.

<h4>Efficient Programming</h4>

<ol>
<li>Avoid use of the ENTRY statement.  The PACKAGE statement is a more efficient way of grouping
multiple externally-callable entry points in a single compile unit.
If you do have a procedure with multiple entries, try to minimize the number of RETURN statements.
<li>Avoid use of data declared FIXED DECIMAL OPTIONS(IBM).
<li>Any use of the GET and PUT statements, including GET STRING and PUT STRING,
in a statically-linked program causes library conversion and format-processing 
code to be included.  If there are only have one or two GET or PUT statements, 
consider using record I/O and formatting the data yourself.  
The PL/I runtime library itself does not use any stream I/O.
<li>Read and write as much data as possible with a single GET or PUT statement.
Instead of:<br><pre><tt>
  PUT LIST(a);
  PUT LIST(b);
use:
  PUT LIST(a,b);
</tt></pre>
<li>Use "adjustable" strings and arrays only when necessary.
<li>The SUBSCRIPTRANGE condition is intended for debugging and it's use in a 
    production program is discouraged.
<li>Use the SIZE and STRINGSIZE prefixes only when necessary as they
    can generate a lot of code.
    Apply the prefix to the smallest piece of code necessary (procedure, block, or single statement).
<li>When possible provide your own checks to prevent computational conditions such as
    FIXEDOVERFLOW for FIXED DECIMAL data rather than relying on an ON-unit.
<li>Aggregate asssignment to very large AUTOMATIC arrays, with the initial 
    attribute or in an assignment statement, may exceed the compiler's
    available storage.  Use the "PLIFILL" builtin if possible or initialize them in a loop.
<li>The compiler "-N" option (statement offset table) requires 8 bytes per 
    executable statement plus 10 bytes, plus the length of the external procedure 
    or package name.
<li>Array assignments by default generate inline code. For large arrays it is 
    more storage-efficient to code a loop and assign the elements individually. 
    Note the the compiler -O option will use a single block move instruction to 
    assign an entire array if the source and target attributes match.
<li>Minimize references to self-defining structures (REFER option) and 
    iSub-defined arrays, since each reference involves a subroutine call.

<!-- ---- Debugging --- -->
<a name="dbg">

<h4>Debugging PL/I programs</h4>

<h5>Debuggers</h5>
PL/I code has no special requirements for a debugger.  On OS/2, the WATCOM&reg; debugger 
may be used to debug PL/I programs;  on Linux gdb works well.<br>
Source-level debugging is not yet available, but since the
compiler can generate assembly-language output, debugging
at the assembly level is straightforward.
<p>
Sometimes it may be desirable to compile-in a breakpoint
to be activated when a specific location is reached or
condition occurs.  The following statement inserted in your
source will activate a breakpoint when it is reached when running
under control of a debugger:
<pre><tt> *PROCESS DBG(INT3); </tt></pre>
If the resulting executable is <u>not</u> run under a debugger, the
interrupt will be ignored.  Nevertheless, INT3 traps should not be
left in a production program.
<p>
<h5>SNAP traceback</h5>
The PL/I statement "ON CONDITION(xxx) SNAP..." will generate a traceback
on stderr when the specified condition is raised.  Beginning with the procedure
generating the traceback (_pli_Trace) and working backwards, the trace
lists the address of the active entry point of the procedure, the address
of the statement in the calling procedure that called that entry, and
the name of the entry point if available.
<p>
<h5>PLIDUMP</h5>
The PL/I statement "CALL PLIDUMP( "&lt;options&gt;", "&lt;title&gt;" );
will generate debugging output on stderr when executed.<br>
"title" is a character string used as the <a href="#dmpt">title</a> of the dump.<br>
"options" provide one or more dump options:<br>
'S' = terminate after dump<br>
'C' = continue after dump<br>
'T' = print <a href="#trc">traceback</a><br>
'B' = dump automatic storage.<br>
'H' = dump static storage (not yet implemented).<br>
'F' = dump opened file information (not yet implemented).<p>
Options may be combined and may appear in
any order, for example "TCB" means: print trace, continue after snap, and dump
all automatic storage. Case is not significant. Unrecognized options are ignored.<p>
The stack is dumped from the current procedure (_pli_Dump) [lowest address] to
the PL/I startup code (_pli_Init) [highest address].  Storage for each procedure is 
dumped in three sections (see sample segment of PLIDUMP output below): 
<a href="#tmp">Temporaries</a> (argument lists
and storage used during expression evaluation), 
<a href="#dat">Data</a> (AUTOMATIC variables and other non-temporary user data in
the stack frame), 
and <a href="#dsa">DSA</a> (system data in stack frame).  The layout of the DSA is 
given in lib\include\dsa.inc.  This is subject to change in future releases.<p>
If the dump is issued as result of a system exception or trap, <a href="#trp">trap information</a>
will appear immmediately before the DSA of the procedure in which the exception occurred.  The 
line beginning "System Code" will display the system error code and description.
<p> 
Each data line includes the
actual address of the first byte, the hex offset (&#177;EBP for DSA and data, +ESP 
for temporaries), up to sixteen bytes of data in hex as actually stored in memory 
(no byte-swapping), and the ASCII representation of the same data.<p>
The DSA display provides additional formatted information regarding the ON-conditions
enabled for this block and identifies runtime-library procedures.

<h5>Using the procedure map</h5>
The <a name="off">procedure map</a> can be used in conjunction with a runtime
error message, SNAP output, or PLIDUMP to determine the line in the program causing 
the error.
<p>
If the error occurs in your PL/I program the runtime error message will identify the
source line causing the error, if the procedure map was generated at compile time.
If the error occurs in a library procedure this information is less meaningful [in a
 future release the message will identify the source line where the library
procedure was invoked]. Given the SNAP output or corresponding PLIDUMP information
and the link map the offset in your code that called the library procedure can be 
computed. This offset can then be used with the procedure map to determine the
line number which originally caused the error.  The <i>offset</i> in the map is the 
offset in the program of the <u>first</u> machine-language instruction for the
source line identified by <i>line</i>. The computed offset between that shown
in the map and the offset for the next line will identify the appropriate line number. 
Program initialization code is included in a separate area of code labeled
"Initialization" following the END statement of the procedure or BEGIN-Block  for which
the initialization is being performed.
