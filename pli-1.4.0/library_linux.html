<h1>About the Iron Spring PL/I Library [Linux]</h1>
The Iron Spring PL/I Library is copyright Iron Spring Software, 2023.<p>
The complete library is released under the terms of the 
<a href="lib/lgpl.html">Gnu Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>.

<p>
In the following, &lt;release&gt; represents the current release.  For this
version that is pli-1.4.0.
<p>
This document describes the details of the Linux version of the library.  
For the OS/2 version see <a href="./library_os2.html">library_os2</a>.
<p>
The supplied makefile will build a static object library in &lt;release&gt;/lib/libprf.a.

The complete library sources are found in &lt;release&gt;/lib/source (PL/I source code),
&lt;release&gt;/lib/source/asm (OS-independent assembler source code and includes), and &lt;release&gt;/lib/include
(PL/I include files).
Operating system dependent sources are in &lt;release&gt;/lib/source/OS2 and &lt;release&gt;/lib/source/linux  To modify the library, make your changes to the
source, <b>cd</b> to &lt;release&gt;/lib, and type <b>make linux</b>.
<p>
The startup procedure "_pli_Start" (&lt;release&gt;/lib/asm/plistart.asm) needs to be linked 
with the main procedure, and references the external symbol "_pli_Main", which is defined for each
OPTIONS(MAIN) procedure.  The symbol 'main' is defined as an alias for "_pli_Start".
<p>
The directory &lt;release&gt;/lib/include contains definitions of the data areas used by the library, with descriptive 
comments.  The following might be of particular interest:
<dl>
<dt>desc.inc<dd>Definitions of PL/I "data descriptor" formats.
<dt>dsa.inc<dd>The PL/I standard stack frame header for a procedure or BEGIN-block.
<dt>errno.inc<dd>Preprocessor labels for kernel error return codes (like errno.h).
<dt>fcb.inc<dd>The PL/I "file control block".
<dt>gbl.inc<dd>Global data used by PL/I program and library.  Note the this control block
contains eight bytes reserved for user data.
<dt>plitabs.inc<dd>The definition of the stream output "tabs" control block.  This is intended for
the use of user programs.<br>
See the IBM PL/I for MVS and VM Programmers' Guide for a description of PLITABS.
<dt>sig_txt.inc<dd>Text labels for system signals.
<dt>stat.inc<dd>Preprocessor labels for file permissions (from sys/stat.h).
